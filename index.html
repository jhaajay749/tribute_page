          <ul>
            <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li>
              <b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of
              Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in
              the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I
              saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on
              me."

              <b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid
              off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he

              breeding pest-resistent plants.

              <b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
              Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his
              lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
              disinfectants, and other applied science.
            </li>

              <b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves
              behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
              pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
              different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
              varieties for each major climate on Earth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season,
              doubling wheat yields
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
              high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well
              to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of

              <b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M
              University
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food supply
              by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
              we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
              crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
              modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we
              called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
